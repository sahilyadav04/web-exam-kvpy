Me = Sahil, I got AIR 16 in KVPY SX 2021. I will try to give you some tips that might become useful to you.

## About it
Annual exam mostly followed by interview for 11th, 12th, Bsc 1st year students to provide scholarship for pursuing degree in pure science subjects and an id card to access most indian science labs. 
More info click [here](http://www.kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/)

## Important Instructions
- The heart of exam is in testing the scientific clarity of subjects and it should be gained step by step starting with NCERTs of each subject and class notes and then moving to books recommended by your teachers or present below whichever suitable.
- Previous year papers must be done to get an idea of question types. You can use arihant publication books for both sa and sb/sx. 
- I recommend 2009 paper should be done (more interesting subjective question present)

## B-OK.CC
If you are comfortable reading on laptop or computer , on this [website](b-ok.cc) you will get most of books mentioned in this article  for FREE

## Physics
FOR 11TH STUDENTS
- learn basics of electricity and optics(although in 12th but frequently asked) and any other 12th topic they find worth reading.

FOR ALL
- after practicing basic questions you can use [IE IRODOV](https://www.amazon.in/Problems-GENERAL-PHYSICS-I-Irodov/dp/9351762564/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ie+irodov&qid=1639709529&sprefix=ie+iro%2Caps%2C526&sr=8-1) to try few  questions.
- if you have more time left for physics you can read [Resnick halliday](https://www.amazon.in/Principles-Physics-Halliday-Robert-Resnick/dp/8126552565/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=resnick+halliday+physics&qid=1639709734&smid=AT95IG9ONZD7S&sprefix=resnick%2Caps%2C583&sr=8-2) nice book.
- or some [inpho questions](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/how-to-prepare/past-papers/)
- and still time left for physics then use [pathfinder for physics](https://www.amazon.in/Pathfinder-Olympiad-Tiwari-Singh-Jangid/dp/9332568715/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=pathfinder+physics+for+jee+advanced&qid=1639712669&sprefix=pathfinder+phy%2Caps%2C1044&sr=8-3)

 - NS AVASTHI - PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
 - MS CHAUHAN - ORGANIC PRACICE
